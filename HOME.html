	<h1 style="text-align:left">My work is heavily rooted in my Filipino culture, my environment and my upbringing. Growing up drawing taught me my flow. My culture gave me meaning. It taught me glyphics, symbology, philosophy, and modern day tribalism. Hip hop and reggae taught me rhythm; the music, the beats, the dance. All these aspects of my soul reflect what I create whether it be through photography, digital art or physical art. I create for myself and for the people. I enjoy doing the craft. It’s only right that I get to share my work with others. I’m a SOUL creator. We may become the leader of something but we’re always a student of the craft. You can feel my vibe in the flow of my art style. My beliefs through my culture and upbringing all reflect my art.  </h1>
